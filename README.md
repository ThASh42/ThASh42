## 📃 About

Hi 👋, I'm Dmytro - a Backend Python Django Developer specializing in API development and database management.

I've been enjoying backend development for the first time ever since I was introduced to Flask with Python. Data management, working with servers, and a fascinating concept of the internet were enough to make me want to work with server-side development rather than front-end development.

I am currently searching for a Backend Python Developer role, especially one that involves working with Django. I would love to work for a company and influence web application logic. I am always open to chat.
